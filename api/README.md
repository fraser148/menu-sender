## Development

If you have install more dependencies, you must add them to the `requirements.txt` file

```bash
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To install requirements into your venv:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create your virtual environment in Python

```bash
python -m venv env
```

Enter your venv:

```bash
env/Scripts/activate
```

You must install the vscode extension PyLint to use the `.pylintrc` file for linting.
